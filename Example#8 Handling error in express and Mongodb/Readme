To handle the errors we need to use two plugin .
To handle errors from mongodb: we need to use mongoose-mongodb-errors package, it give very readable errors..
    install: npm i mongoose-mongodb-errors
    then add the plugin 
        mongoose.plugin(mongodbErrorHandler); in the model 
Second we can also handle the errors from async await by
    using the package: express-async-errors
    npm i express-async-errors
    then just require it in the server file
